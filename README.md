Hey guys,

So I am a huge gamer, big fan of games like TF2 and recentyl Overwatch which has taken up a lot of my study time. In Overwatch there are loot boxes containing items of various rarities and I wanted to measure how much you get per box using measured statistics from many many loot box purchases over time. So I simulate opening a loot box until all items are gained then it reports how many it took and it runs this as many times as needed to get a good rough approximation of what number of loot box is necessary on average to get all items in the game.

Eventually I'd like to include users opening loot boxes through the terminal with responses such as "you got a anna spray" but that takes a bit of time and since they arent measured well enough I'd have to personally go in and count how many items and set parameters for what item belongs to what character so thats a bit down the line from now.
